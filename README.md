sfft
====

This is my FFT project from grad school.

sfft = Specialized FFT

For those who are curious: This is **NOT** the same FFT that is used by y-cruncher.<br>
y-cruncher's FFT takes a completely different approach that's optimized for small sizes.

Note that this was a research project that has never been "prepared" for public use.
So it isn't particularly well organized, nor is there a usable interface.

I no longer have the time and resources to develop and maintain this project.
But I may, from time-to-time, do minor updates and clean-ups.

This project and all the associated source code was done during my time at the University of Illinois.
All rights to this project are jointly owned by me and the University of Illinois.
